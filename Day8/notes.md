AM
---------
- HTML & CSS do content & styling, respectively
- we've done JS "the programming language" 
  - ifs, vars, fors, etc
- we've looked at a _little_ JS "for the web" -- JS that 
  allows us to select elements and modify them, etc...

Today, we move on. From static sites to interactive/dynamic
applications, that _do_ more. Pull in data from elsewhere. 
Allow users to interact with data.  

- structuring code is HARD. writing these callbacks is 
  tough.
- what's the problem? when you look at the HTML, you have no idea
  what is going to change it, add classes, etc  

- AngularJS is a _framework_. Provides a structured way
  to write web applications. 
    - concept of view, controller, and model
  
demo:
- ng-model & {{ }} (concept of data-binding)
- ng-click and expressions

to build: simple input/display. counter.
stretch: simple lightbox with ng-show

PM
---------
- data-binding, {{ }} again
- declaring a module
- adding a controller and ng-controller directive
- $scope
  - basic variables and displaying them
  - adding complex types
  - functions on the scope
  - lists? 
  
directives to hit: ng-show, ng-model, ng-app, ng-controller, 
    ng-click,
